# 👨‍⚖️User Management System🙎‍♂️🙍‍♀️ Using JDBC and Servlet

## About the Project

This is a dynamic web project created on Eclipse IDE using MYSQL Database and the server used here is Tomcat.Here I have used Advanced Java
technologies like JDBC and Servlet.The web project consists of boostraped styled html pages as user interface called as home.html which serves as the welcome
file in the deployment web page.There is a registration form asking various inputs from the users and then provide facility to register the user with all the details
in the database.The project allows to retreive the users list and also editing and deleting every individual users thus providing dynamic response
and dynamic updation of the database.In the server side I have used Servlet component for each module allowing CRUD Operations(Create,Retrieve,Update,Delete).
